\section{Graded written problem}

\textbf{Part a:} Two Travelling Turkey Problem (TTTP) as mentioned in the written problem has the following contraints:
\begin{itemize}
\item Each city is visited at least once
\item Number of distinct routes has to be as small as possible
\item Each city can be visited any number of times
\item Path starts and ends at the same city
\item Maximum of the total effort of the two turkeys is minimized
\end{itemize}

To formally describe the problem we will consider a complete graph $G = (V, E)$ with $2$ edge-weight functions $w_a: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $w_h: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. Where $w_a(e)$ represents the effort taken by \textit{Abe} to travel along the edge $e$ from a city on one end of the edge to the other, while $w_h(e)$ represents the effort required by \textit{Honest}

With the above definition for the graph $G$ we can describe the decision version of the problem as:

For the graph G and $k \in \mathbb{R}$, report \textit{yes} if there exists a spanning tree $S$ such that $MAX(\sum_{\forall e \in S}{w_a(e)}, \sum_{\forall e \in S}{w_h(e)})$ is at-most $k$, else report \textit{no}.

\textbf{Part b:} Decision problem is NP-complete

To prove that TTTP decision problem is NP-complete, we will show that Partition Set(PS) that is a known NP-complete problem, can be reduced to TTTP problem.
Given a set $S$ of Real numbers and the sum of all elements in $S$ as $2*w$, we compute a graph $G$, such that $G$ has a spanning tree $ST$ with $MAX(\sum_{\forall e \in ST}{w_a(e)}, \sum_{\forall e \in ST}{w_h(e)}) \leq w$ only if we can Partition the set using PS algorithm.

To transform the elements of $S$ to the graph $G$ we create a root node, and for every element $i$ in $S$ and add two vertices with edge weight as ($w_a = S[i]$, $w_h = 0$) and ($w_a = 0$, $w_h = S[i]$) to the root note. The edge weight between these two vertices is (0,0). Construct this gadget with all the elements in $S$ and make it a complete graph by connecting all the unconnected vertices with edge weights ($w_a = \infty$,$w_h = \infty$).

Now, if the TTTP-decision problem returns that \textit{yes} we claim that we can partition the set $S$ in $2$ subsets such that each subset has sum $w$. This is possible when the TTTP-decision problem can find a spanning tree in the graph $G$ such that $\sum_{\forall e \in ST}{w_a(e)} = \sum_{\forall e \in ST}{w_h(e)} = w$. All the weights returned by $w_a(e)$ can be considered elements of one subset and the weights returned by $w_h(e)$ the elements of the other subset for the \textit{Partition} problem on set $S$, and we can see that these subsets contain all the elements of set $S$ and their sums are equal and so the PS-decision problem on set will also return \textit{yes}.

If the TTTP-decision problem returns \textit{no}, then consider a spanning tree made of edges whose weights are not $\infty$. Such a spanning tree will have minimum total edge weight for $w_e$ and $w_h$ summed together of $2*w$ when all the elements in the set $S$ either as the edge weights for one turkey or the other. Now since we cannot find a spanning tree, wherein $\sum_{\forall e \in ST}{w_a(e)} \leq w$ and $\sum_{\forall e \in ST}{w_h(e)} \leq w$, because if one of them is less than $w$ then the other one will be greater than $w$. And hence these set of edge weights cannot be used to create a solution for the PS problem, so PS-decision problem will also return \textit{no}.

Thus, PS-decision can be reduced to TTTP-decision problem and so TTTP-decision problem is NP-complete.
